# Ball Animation

A tiny project that I started on the train to and from Bath to try and learn about how Javascript can interact with CSS. Turns out, it's not too bad!

## Getting the ball rolling

This is made from simple static files, so in order to run this project:
clone it

Alternatively, you can just look at this picture, it's basically the same, except the ball moves.

### 1) Clone Repository

```
$  git clone https://github.com/whatsrupp/ball-animation
```

### 2) Direct

```
$  cd file/location/of/ball-animation
```

### 3) Open the index page
```
$ open index.html
```
which should then open your default browser!


## Testing

Had a little Jasmine refresher for this one - Spicy.

As with the main project there's nothing much to see, but if you want to run the tests then type in the following into terminal.
```
$  cd file/location/of/jasmine/SpecRunner.html
$ open SpecRunner.html
```
